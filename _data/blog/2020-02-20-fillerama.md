#### Traditional:
* Applications ran on physical servers. 
* No way to define resource boundaries for applications

#### Virtualized:
* Run multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) on a single physical serverâ€™s CPU. 
* Application isolation between VMs
* Security as a result of the isolation

#### Container: 
* Share the Operating System (OS) among the applications. 
* Lightweight. 
* Own filesystem, CPU, memory, process space, etc. 
* Decoupled from infrastructure, 
* Portable.

## Benefits Provided by Containers:
* Agile Delivery
* Continuous development, integration, and deployment.
* Observability
* Addresses Environment Drift.
* Portability
* Loosely coupled - not monolithic
* Ability to define resource boundaries - resource isolation, efficient utilization.
